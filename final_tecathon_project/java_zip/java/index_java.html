      <h2>Basics</h2>
      <p>Learn the fundamentals of Java language.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Variables and Data Types:</strong> In Java, variables are used to store data temporarily in computer memory. They have specific data types which determine the kind of data they can hold and how it is interpreted. Here's a brief overview of common data types in Java:<br>

          <b>1) Boolean Data Type:</b> Boolean data type represents only one bit of information either true or false which is intended to represent the two truth values of logic and Boolean algebra, but the size of the boolean data type is virtual machine-dependent. Values of type boolean are not converted implicitly or explicitly (with casts) to any other type. But the programmer can easily write conversion code.<br>
          
          <b>2) Byte Data Type:</b> The byte data type is an 8-bit signed two’s complement integer. The byte data type is useful for saving memory in large arrays.<br>
      
         <b> 3) Float Data Type</b> The float data type is a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating-point. Use a float (instead of double) if you need to save memory in large arrays of floating-point numbers. The size of the float data type is 4 bytes (32 bits).<br>
          
        <b>  4) Char Data Type:</b> The char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character with the size of 2 bytes (16 bits).<br>
          
         <b> 5) Double Data Type:</b> The double data type is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating-point. For decimal values, this data type is generally the default choice. The size of the double data type is 8 bytes or 64 bits.<br>
          
         <b> 6)Integer Data Type:</b> It is a 32-bit signed two’s complement integer.<br></li>
         <br>
        <li><strong> Here's a brief overview of contorl flow in Java:<br></strong> 
        
          <b>1. If statement</b>The Java if statement is the most simple decision-making statement. It is used to decide whether a certain statement or block of statements will be executed or not i.e if a certain condition is true then a block of statement is executed otherwise not.<br>
          Syntax: <br> 
          <br>
          if(condition) <br>
          {<br>
              // Statements to execute if<br>
             // condition is true<br>
          }<br>
          <br>
          <b>2. If-else</If-else> statement</b>If-else is conditional statements that execute according to the correct statement executed. If the if condition is true then the code block inside the if statement is executed else it executes the else statement block.<br>
          Syntax of if-else Statement<br>
          <br>
          if (condition)<br>
            {<br>
               // Executes this block if<br>
               // condition is true<br>
            }<br>
          else<br>
            {<br>
               // Executes this block if<br>
              // condition is false<br>
            }<br>
            <br>
         
            <b>3.  if-else-if ladder</b>Java if-else-if ladder is used to decide among multiple options. The if statements are executed from the top down. As soon as one of the conditions controlling the if is true, the statement associated with that if is executed, and the rest of the ladder is bypassed. If none of the conditions is true, then the final else statement will be executed.<br>
            Syntax:  <br>
            <br>
              if (condition)<br>
              {<br>
                statement 1;<br>
              }<br>
            else if (condition)<br>
               {<br>
                 statement 2;<br>
               }<br>
                  .<br>
                  .<br>
                else<br>
              statement;<br>
              <br>
              <br>
        
        <li><strong>Loops in the Java:</strong> Loops in the Java are constructs used to repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met. There are three main types of loops in Java:<br>

         <b> i) For Loop:</b> for loop provides a concise way of writing the loop structure. Unlike a while loop, a for statement consumes the initialization, condition and increment/decrement in one line thereby providing a shorter, easy to debug structure of looping. <br>
          Syntax:<br>
          <br>
          for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) 
          {<br>
            <br>
              // Code block to be executed repeatedly<br>
          }<br>
         <b> ii) While Loop:</b> The while loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as the given condition is true.<br>
         Syntax:<br>
         <br>
          while (condition) {<br>
              // Code block to be executed repeatedly
          }<br>
         <b> iii) Do-While Loop:</b> The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the code block is executed at least once before checking the condition to continue.<br>
         Syntax:<br>
         <br>
          do {<br>
              // Code block to be executed <br>repeatedly
          } while (condition);<br></li>

      <h2>Advanced</h2>
      <p>Dive deeper into advanced C topics and techniques.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pointers:</strong>In C language, a pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. It allows indirect access to a memory location, which is useful for dynamic memory allocation, passing parameters by reference, and building complex data structures like linked lists and trees. Pointers are fundamental for low-level programming tasks and are used extensively in system programming and embedded systems development.</li>
        <li><strong>Java Classes:</strong> 
          A class in Java is a set of objects which shares common characteristics/ behavior and common properties/ attributes. It is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. For example, Student is a class while a particular student named Ravi is an object.<br>
          <br></li>
          <li><strong>Java Objects:</strong> 
            An object in Java is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming and represents real-life entities. Objects are the instances of a class that are created to use the attributes and methods of a class.  A typical Java program creates many objects, which as you know, interact by invoking methods.<br>
             An object consists of : <br>
               <b> 1.State:</b> It is represented by attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.<br>
               <b>2.Behavior:</b> It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object with other objects.<br>
                <b>3.Identity:</b> It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.<br><br>
        <li><strong>Array:</strong> Array is a group of like-typed variables referred to by a common name. Arrays in Java work differently than they do in C/C++. Following are some important points about Java arrays. <br>
          Arrays in Java
          In Java, all arrays are dynamically allocated. (discussed below)
          Arrays may be stored in contiguous memory [consecutive memory locations].
          Since arrays are objects in Java, we can find their length using the object property length. This is different from C/C++, where we find length using sizeof.
          A Java array variable can also be declared like other variables with [] after the data type.
          The variables in the array are ordered, and each has an index beginning with 0.
          Java array can also be used as a static field, a local variable, or a method parameter.
          An array can contain primitives (int, char, etc.) and object (or non-primitive) references of a class depending on the definition of the array. In the case of primitive data types, the actual values might be stored in contiguous memory locations(JVM does not guarantee this behavior). In the case of class objects, the actual objects are stored in a heap segment. </li><br>
          <li><strong>Java Constructors:</strong>
            Java constructors or constructors in Java is a terminology used to construct something in our programs. A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created. It can be used to set initial values for object attributes.<br>
            In Java, a Constructor is a block of codes similar to the method. It is called when an instance of the class is created. At the time of calling the constructor, memory for the object is allocated in the memory. It is a special type of method that is used to initialize the object. Every time an object is created using the new() keyword, at least one constructor is called.</li> <br>
            <li><strong>Inheritance in Java:</strong>
              Java, Inheritance is an important pillar of OOP(Object-Oriented Programming). It is the mechanism in Java by which one class is allowed to inherit the features(fields and methods) of another class. In Java, Inheritance means creating new classes based on existing ones. A class that inherits from another class can reuse the methods and fields of that class. In addition, you can add new fields and methods to your current class as well.  <br>
              The extends keyword is used for inheritance in Java. Using the extends keyword indicates you are derived from an existing class. In other words, “extends” refers to increased functionality. </li><br>
              <li><strong>Abstraction in Java:</strong>
                Abstraction in Java is the process in which we only show essential details/functionality to the user. The non-essential implementation details are not displayed to the user. <br>
                Data Abstraction may also be defined as the process of identifying only the required characteristics of an object ignoring the irrelevant details. The properties and behaviours of an object differentiate it from other objects of similar type and also help in classifying/grouping the objects.</li>
